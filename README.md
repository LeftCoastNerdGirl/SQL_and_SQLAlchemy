# SQL coding using SQLAlchemy, data modeling using QuickDB and pgAdmin

The first part of this challenge focused on data modeling and data engineering. Loading the 6 csv data files into QuickDB, then creating an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) showing primary keys, foreign keys, and idenfitying data types. pgAdmin was a secondary option, also included in the ERD folder output.

The second challenge in this project focused on data analysis of those same csv files. This work involved loading the data into a Pandas dataframe. From there, various analysis points were created:

List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.  
List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.  
List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.  
List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.  
List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.  
List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.  
List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.  
List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
